# SPAM_MAIL_DEDECTION
IT IS AN MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT USED TO DETECT THE SPAM MAIL WITH THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL 
Spam Mail Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning application that detects spam emails using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The goal of the project is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

Features
Preprocessing of email data (tokenization, text cleaning, vectorization)
Implementation of SVM for classification
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of model performance
Easy-to-use interface for classifying new emails
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn (for SVM model and data processing)
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib and seaborn (for visualizations)
NLTK or spaCy (for text preprocessing)
