# SPAM_MAIL_DEDECTION
IT IS AN MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT USED TO DETECT THE SPAM MAIL WITH THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL 
Spam Mail Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning application that detects spam emails using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The goal of the project is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

## Features
Preprocessing of email data (tokenization, text cleaning, vectorization)
Implementation of SVM for classification
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of model performance
Easy-to-use interface for classifying new emails
Technologies Used
## Programming Language: Python
## Libraries:
scikit-learn (for SVM model and data processing)
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib and seaborn (for visualizations)
NLTK or spaCy (for text preprocessing)
## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed and follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
https://github.com/nikhilyedelli/SPAM_MAIL_DEDECTION/edit/main/README.md
cd spam-mail-detection-svm
Install the required packages:



## Kaggle's Email Spam Dataset
Or any dataset of your choice containing labeled emails.
The dataset should be in CSV format with columns for the email content and its respective label (spam or ham).

## Model Training
Data Preprocessing:

Emails are cleaned by removing stopwords, punctuations, and non-alphanumeric characters.
Text is tokenized and transformed into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization or Bag of Words.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

The SVM algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
The model is trained on the training data and then evaluated on the test set.
Model Parameters:

Kernel: Linear
Regularization (C): 1.0 (default)
Gamma: Auto
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

## Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified emails
Precision: Proportion of predicted spam that is actually spam
Recall: Proportion of actual spam emails correctly identified
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
You can generate a confusion matrix and ROC curve to visualize the performance.

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can classify new emails as follows:

Run the Python script to load the model and classify an email:

## bash
Copy code
python classify_email.py --email "Enikhilyedelli23@gmail.com"
Example output:

csharp
Copy code
The email is classified as: SPAM
You can also use the classify_email.py file to integrate this spam detection model into any email system or application.

## Future Work
Improve the model by experimenting with different feature extraction methods (e.g., word embeddings like Word2Vec).
Use more advanced models like neural networks to increase accuracy.
Implement a web-based application for easier deployment.
